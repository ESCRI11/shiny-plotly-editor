# A simple Plotly chart editor

This chart editor app was derived from the ["basic" demo](https://github.com/plotly/react-chart-editor/tree/master/examples/demo) of Plotly's [react-chart-editor](https://github.com/plotly/react-chart-editor). To run the app locally, do:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once the app is running, say at `http://localhost:3000`, you can then add a `plotURL` search parameter to that URL that points to a JSON representation of the plotly figure. For example, `http://localhost:3000/?plotURL=http://localhost:8000/path/to/plotly_json`
